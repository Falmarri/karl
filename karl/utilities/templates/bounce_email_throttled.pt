<p>Dear KARL User,</p>

<b>YOUR MESSAGE <i>${subject}</i> HAS NOT BEEN POSTED</b>

<p>Due to a high volume of messages sent into KARL from your email account
over the last few minutes, KARL has temporarily disabled your ability to email
messages into the system. This safeguard is in place in order to prevent
unintended Out of Office messages from flooding a KARL community. If you would
still like your message to post to a KARL community, please resend your
message in a few minutes. Your email privileges will be automatically
reactivated in 5 minutes and no additional action is necessary by you. If you
do not have Out of Office auto replies enabled and believe you are receiving
this notification in error, please contact the KARL Help Desk at
karladmin@list.soros.org.</p>

<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
