Distribution List Blueprint TODOs
=================================

Phase 1 -- Report-Driven Lists
------------------------------

- [X] Tidy up mailin adapters / utilities / scripts, get to 100% coverage.

      - See r6451, r6452, r6453, r6454, r6457, r6458, r6459, r6460,
        r6461, r6462, r6463, r6464, r6466, r6467, r6468, r6469, 

- [X] Make the "mailin dispatcher" return 'report' info, in addition to
      'community' info.

      - See r6455.

- [X] Add an ``IMailinHandler`` adapter for reports.

      * Forwards clone of message to all people in the report, with
        'Reply-To' set to the report's mail-in address.

      - See r6470, 6471.

- [X] Make the "mailin runners" cope with 'report' info.

      * Use the report path to pick up the report-as-target.

      * Ensure that appropriate permission checking occurs:  the
        user corresponding to the 'From:' address must have 'email'
        permission on the report (normally KarlStaff).

      * Add an evolve step which grants the 'email' permission to
        'group.KarlStaff' on '/people'.

      - See r6472, r6477, r6478.

- [X] Create ``ReportMailinglist`` object, addable to reports via admin UI.

      * Majyk name, 'mailinglist'.

      * No schema at present:  later, perhaps keeps archive, allows choices
        about ``Reply-To`` header.

      - See r6473.

- [X] Expose ``mailto:`` link on retail view of reports which have a
      ``ReportMailinglist`` in them.

      - See r6474.


Phase 2 -- Moderated lists
--------------------------

Q:  Should these really be communities, with a custom tool?  I.e.,
    shouldn't any community potentially be usable as a mailing list?
